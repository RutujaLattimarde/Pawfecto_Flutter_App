<br />
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Millions of animals are homeless on the streets and are brought to shelters on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Animal shelters play a vital role in our communities as they continuously work to reunite pets with their owners, shelter those in need, and find new homes for animals that are lost, without a permanent home or for those animals that, for our own security, should not be roaming our streets.</p>
<p>Recent research shows that people who prefer to adopt are more prone to surf through the internet before actually visiting the shelter. Hence, it is a necessity to provide a convenient way for the users and shelters to interact. In todayâ€™s world, people prefer to buy pets from stores over adoption, as the health of the pet is considered to be a major issue.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>The main purpose of our app is to find the right match between potential adopters and pets, such that the adopters find a pet that fits their lifestyle. Through this app, we try to bridge the gap between purchase and adoption, and interaction before visits.</p>
